The data and code in this repository are related to the paper titled "Neural Mechanisms of Visual Working Memory Categories via fMRI Decoding"

Bootstrap_weights.m 
Which is a MATLAB script designed for constructing Visual Working Memory Category Decoders (VWMCD) using bootstrap resampling techniques. 
This implementation leverages the ​CANLab neuroimaging analysis toolbox (available via GitHub at https://github.com/canlab)​ to create robust brain-based decoders for visual working memory tasks.
